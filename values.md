# Team Values

First and foremost, we value the great friendship and lasting comradeship that
results from each of us coming together and sharing the mutual enjoyment of
working on collaborative software projects.

All of us have different goals associated with our racing. Each person should strive to recognize each other's goals and support fellow teammates in reaching their individual cycling goals.

All of us have different, important outside obligations, including family, work/careers, school and other interests that require our time and attention. Each person recognizes other's outside obligations and supports teammates in successfully balancing their outside obligations and their racing.

We acknowledge that we have a special organization, one that has outlasted many others. The reason for our specialness and longevity can be traced to the following values and guidelines of conduct:

1. We have deep appreciation from the camaraderie and friendship we get from cycling, therefore; Think of people first.
2. We strive to treat our sponsors with integrity, therefore; Be an active, considerate and positive representative of our sponsors in all interactions with the public. Wear your jersey as often as possible on training rides.
3. We look around at others who physically or mentally burnt out on racing and realize that by keeping this club and our racing pursuits fun, we succeed as individuals on and off our bikes. The untimely death of our teammates, Dave Kagy and Sergio de la Torre, has reinforced our understanding of how precious and fragile are this club and our racing careers, therefore;
    1. In order to keep the club's operations from being a burden on a small group of people, teammate participation in club affairs is required. Teammates who do not actively participate in putting on our annual events will be dropped from the club, unless they have a very good reason that has been explained in advance. The goal of putting on the race is to spread the burden and, by doing so, actually have fun putting it on.
    2. Take your racing seriously, but not too seriously.
    3. Never lose your sense of humor.
