As at 30 April 2014

#ARTICLE I - THE CORPORATION

##1. Name.

The name by which the Corporation shall be known is Creative Commons Corporation (which shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Corporation”). These By-Laws, the
powers of the Corporation, the powers of its Directors and officers, and all matters concerning
the conduct and regulation of the affairs of the Corporation, shall be subject to such provisions in
regard thereto, if any, as are set forth in the Articles of Organization as from time to time in
effect.

## 2. Purpose.

The Corporation is a corporation organized under Chapter 180 of the
Massachusetts General Laws for the purposes enumerated in its Articles of Organization, as they
may be amended from time to time. The principal office of the Corporation in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts shall initially be located at the place set forth in the Articles of
Organization of the Corporation. The Directors of the Corporation may change the location of
the principal office in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts effective upon the filing of a
certificate with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth.

# ARTICLE II – MEMBERSHIP

## 1. Members.

The corporation will have no members. Any action or vote permitted
or required under Chapter 180 of the Massachusetts General Laws, the Articles of Organization
or these By-Laws to be taken by the members of the Corporation shall be taken by action or vote
of the same percentage of the Directors of the Corporation, provided that the Directors abide by
the same notice and meeting requirements as if the action or vote were taken by members.
However, the Directors shall under no circumstances have the power to remove another Director
without cause.

## 2. Participation by Non-Members.

The Board of Directors may, from time to time,
designate certain persons or groups of persons as advisors, friends, sponsors, or contributors of
the Corporation or may designate such persons by such other title as the Board deems
appropriate. Notwithstanding any such designation, however, such persons shall not be members
of the Corporation, and shall have no right to notice of meetings and no right to vote at or to
participate in any meeting of members, and shall have no other rights with respect to the
Corporation.

# ARTICLE III - BOARD OF DIRECTORS

## 1. Powers.

The Board of Directors shall have general management and control over
all of the property, affairs and funds of the Corporation and shall exercise all of the powers of the
Corporation, except as otherwise provided by law, the Articles of Organization or these
By-Laws. The Directors may determine their own duties in addition to those prescribed by the
By-laws but shall not receive compensation for their services as Directors. The Board of
Directors may determine the compensation and duties of all officers, agents, and employees of
the Corporation.
The Corporation may amend or restate its Articles of Organization if approved by a twothirds affirmative vote of the Board of Directors then in office at a meeting duly called for the
purpose and with notice given for such meeting.

## 2. Composition and Management.

The Board of Directors shall consist of no less
than five Directors, one of which shall be the Chief Executive Officer. The Directors shall not
be divided into classes. At each Annual Meeting the Directors shall fix the number of Directors
and shall elect the successors to the Directors. Performance of the Board’s Officers and
Directors may be subject to annual review.

### (a)

The Board shall have a Chair, Vice Chair and Secretary. Appointments to
the Chair and Vice Chair shall endure for one three-year term, and may be renewed once with
approval of the Board of Directors. The Chair and Vice Chair must be voting Directors and
neither may serve beyond his/her tenure as a Director. A Director who takes on an Officer role
mid-term will serve to the remainder of the term of that Office.

### (b)

The Chair shall, when present, preside at all meetings of the Directors and
undertake such other tasks as the Board shall determine.

### (b)

The Vice Chair shall preside at all meetings in the absence of the Chair
and undertake such other tasks as the Board or the Chair shall determine.

### (c)

The Secretary of the Corporation shall keep Minutes and other records of
the meetings and shall be a non-voting member of the Board. The Secretary shall be a nonvoting member of the Board and shall serve at the discretion of the Directors.
These officers shall undertake such other tasks as may be reasonably directed by
the Board. (Amended 12-07-2013)

##3. Tenure.

Board members other than the Chief Executive Officer and Secretary
shall serve one term of 3 years or until the Director sooner dies, resigns, is removed or becomes
disqualified. The Chief Executive Officer and the Secretary shall serve as non-voting Directors
for the duration of their terms of office. To ensure continuity of policies and expertise, the Board
shall aspire to appoint one-third of the Directors each year. The initial term of a new Director or
the final term of an outgoing Director may be made for either 4 or 5 years as may best assure
such continuity. A term may be renewable once for a 3-year period upon approval of the Board.
Thereafter, Board members have the possibility of serving additional terms
after at least a oneyear absence. (Amended 02-06-2014)

## 4. Resignation.

A Director may resign by delivering his resignation in writing to the
Corporation at its principal office or to the Chair or the Secretary of the Corporation. Such
resignation shall be effective upon its receipt or upon such date (if any) as is stated in such
resignation, unless otherwise determined by the Board. (Amended 12-07-2013)

## 5. Removal.

A Director may be removed from office at any time with cause by vote
of a majority of the Directors at a special meeting called for that purpose. A Director may be
removed for cause only if notice of such action shall have been given to all of the Directors prior
to the meeting at which such action is to be taken and if the Director so to be removed shall have
been given reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard before the body proposing to remove
him.

## 6. Vacancies.

from the enlargement of Board, may be filled by vote of a majority of the remaining Directors
present at a meeting of Directors at which a quorum is present or by appointment of all of the
Directors if less than a quorum shall remain in office. Each such Director elected to fill a
vacancy for the unexpired term of the Director whom he replaced shall hold office until a
successor is elected and qualified, or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. The
Directors shall have and may exercise all of their powers notwithstanding the existence of one or
more vacancies in their number.

## 7. Enlargement or Decrease in Number of the Board.

The number of members of
the Board of Directors may be increased or decreased at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting
by a vote of a majority of Directors then in office; provided that the number of Directors may
only be decreased to eliminate vacancies resulting from the death, resignation, removal or
disqualification of one or more Directors.

## 8. Annual Meetings.

An annual meeting of the Directors (“Annual Meeting”) shall
be held on a date, time and place to be fixed by the Board of Directors or the Chair (which date
shall not be a legal holiday in the place where the meeting is to be held) and stated in the notice
of the meeting. If no Annual Meeting is held in accordance with the foregoing provision, a
special meeting may be held in lieu thereof with the same effect as the Annual Meeting and in
such case all references in these By-Laws, except in this Section, to the Annual Meeting shall be
deemed to refer to such special meeting. (Amended 6-20-08 and 12-07-2013)

or restating the Corporation’s Articles of Organization: An emailed notice of such meeting
stating the place, day and time thereof and the purpose for which the meeting is called, shall be
given by the Secretary or other person calling the meeting to each Director at least seven days
before the meeting. Notice shall be deemed properly given when sent by email and properly
addressed to the Director at the Director’s address as it appears in the records of the Corporation,
or when left with the Director or at the Director’s residence or usual place of business, or when
sent by telephone, telegram, telecopy, or other electronic means to the Director at the Director’s
telephone number, or address as it appears in the records of the Corporation, at least seven days
before the meeting. Whenever notice of a meeting is required, such notice need not be given to a
Director if a written waiver of notice, executed by him (or his duly authorized attorney) before or
after the meeting, is filed with the records of the meeting. (Amended 12-07-2013)

### (b)

The following notice requirements shall apply to all regular meetings and
special meetings called for any purpose other than to amend or restate the Corporation’s Articles
of Organization and shall apply to all special meetings except a special meeting in lieu of an
Annual Meeting: Notice of the time and place of each meeting of the Board of Directors shall be
given to each Director by email (properly addressed), telephone, or other electronic means sent at
least forty-eight hours before the meeting. Notice shall be deemed properly given by email when
addressed and sent to the Director at the Director’s address as it appears in the records of the
Corporation. Whenever notice of a meeting is required, such notice need not be given to any
Director if a written waiver of notice, executed by him (or his attorney duly authorized) before or
after the meeting, is filed with the records of the meeting, or to any Director who attends the
meeting without protesting the lack of notice before the meeting or before action is taken at the
meeting. Neither such notice nor waiver of notice need specify the purposes of the meeting,
unless otherwise required by law, the Articles of Organization or these By-Laws. (Amended 1207-2013)

When a quorum is
present at any meeting of the Directors, a majority of the Directors present and voting (excluding
abstentions) shall decide any question, including the election of officers, unless otherwise
provided by law, the Articles of Organization, or these By-Laws. Any action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting,
if all of the Directors consent to the action in writing and the written consents are filed with the
records of the meetings of the Board of Directors. Such consents shall be treated for all purposes
as a vote at a meeting. Directors or members of any committee designated by the Directors may
participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee by means of a conference
telephone or similar communications equipment, provided that all persons participating in the
meeting can hear each other at the same time; in such event, participation by such means shall
constitute presence in person at a meeting. (Amended 6-20-08)

## 13. Quorum.

At any meeting of the Board of Directors, one-third of the Directors
then in office shall constitute a quorum provided, however, that said quorum includes at least
two members of any current Executive Committee. Each Director shall have one vote. Any
meeting may be adjourned by a majority of the votes cast upon the question,
whether or not a quorum is present, and the meeting may be held as adjourned
without further notice.

## 14. Board Committees.

The Directors may elect or appoint one or more committees
(including but not limited to an Executive Committee) and may delegate to any such committee
or committees any or all of their powers, provided that any committee to which the powers of the
Directors are delegated shall consist solely of Directors. Unless the Directors otherwise
determine, an Executive Committee elected by the Directors shall have the power to act for the
full Board of Directors on all matters between meetings of the Directors, except for such matters
as are specified in Massachusetts General Laws Section 55 of Chapter 156B. Unless the
Directors otherwise designate, committees shall conduct their affairs in the same manner as is
provided in these By-Laws for the Directors. The members of any committee shall remain in

Audit Committee and the Executive Committee. (Amended 1-07-05, 12-09-11)

## 15. Board of Advisors.

The Directors may create a board of advisors in an advisory
capacity to the Board of Directors and appoint to such board certain persons who are interested
in furthering the purposes of the Corporation. The Directors may appoint one or more additional
advisory boards for the sole purpose of advising the Board of Directors. Any advice rendered by
the board of advisors or any such advisory board may be considered by the Board of Directors
but shall not be binding on the Board of Directors. Advisory boards created by the Board consist
of the Advisory Council and the Development Council.. (Amended 12-09-11 and 12-07-2013)
